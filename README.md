# Python_WebScraping_Console
This is my own python project. For instance , this is not a GUI python app, but a simple console program. What u can do , is to write a famous people's name (That NECESSARY Exists in Wikipedia !!!!) , and the program will find the famous person's Birthday Date ..
If u want to test my program , just upload the file , install necessary python packages if required ..Then it starts to work..
